# Screens (increments 07–10)

How the operational screens are built on the shell from increment 06
(`docs/FRONTEND_SHELL.md`), against the API contract in `docs/API_PORT.md`.
The legacy single-file SPA (`vrinspector/frontend` →
`staging_snapshot_20260716/staging_index_with_help_private.html`) is the
behavioural spec: same screens, same request bodies, same vocabulary.

## Increment 07 — projects + inspections

### Routes

| Route | Legacy | Screen |
|---|---|---|
| `/projects` | `renderProjects` | Project list: filter box, count, "New project", one card per project (name, client — location, status badge) |
| `/projects/$projectId` | `openProject` → `renderInspections` | Project: details card, header menu (Edit / Delete project — owners), inspections list with filter box and "New inspection" |
| `/projects/$projectId/inspections/$inspectionId` | `openInspection` + the sign-off bar of `renderFindingsScreen` | Inspection: details, Block 8B sign-off bar, Sign off / Reopen, header menu (Edit / Delete inspection); findings + photos section reserved for increment 08 |

Routes are file-based under `src/routes/_layout/projects/`; "Projects" stays
highlighted in the sidebar for the nested screens (`isNavItemActive`). Every
detail screen has the back arrow the legacy top bar had (`PageHeader
backTo`), so phone navigation does not depend on the sidebar.

### Data

`src/lib/queries.ts` holds the query keys and `queryOptions` for projects,
one project, its members, its inspections and one inspection. Mutations
invalidate by prefix (`["projects", id]` covers the project, its members and
its inspections) — the equivalent of the legacy screen reloads. Successful
edits also `setQueryData` on the object so the screen updates without a
flash.

Request bodies match the legacy SPA's:

| Action | Body |
|---|---|
| Create project | `{name, client, location, status}` — blanks sent as `null`; `created_by` is no longer sent because the API stamps the verified identity |
| Create inspection | `{project_id, status: "open", title, inspection_type, inspector, notes}` |
| Edit project / inspection | the same fields via `PUT` (the legacy SPA had no edit; the API routes exist since increment 04) |
| Sign off / reopen | `PATCH …/signoff`, `PATCH …/reopen`, no body |

Ids in the URL are parsed with `parseId`: anything that is not a positive
integer renders `NotFoundState` without a request. A 404 from the API
renders the same state (the routers hide objects the caller may not see);
other failures render `ErrorState` with a retry (`DetailState` in
`components/Common/States.tsx`). An inspection reached under the wrong
project id also renders not-found.

### Roles

`useProjectRole(projectId)` reads the members list and matches the caller
the way the API does (`user_sub`, else email case-insensitively) to decide
which buttons to show: viewers see no write actions, inspectors no project
edit/delete. While the role is unknown (loading, or the caller is not in the
list) the actions stay visible and a 403 is explained by the toast — the API
is the authority (`docs/API_PORT.md`, role policy).

### Forms

react-hook-form + zod, in a `Dialog`, one component per object used for
both create and edit (`ProjectFormDialog`, `InspectionFormDialog`). Fixed
vocabularies use a styled native `<select>` (`components/ui/native-select`):
on phones and iPads the OS picker is the better one-handed control and it
needs no JavaScript to open. Confirmations (`ConfirmDialog`) replace the
legacy `window.confirm` for deletes and for sign-off.

### Components added

| Component | Use |
|---|---|
| `Common/ListCard` | the tappable card (title, meta line, badges, "›") as a router link |
| `Common/FilterInput` | the client-side contains-filter box over loaded cards |
| `Common/ConfirmDialog` | two-step confirmation with a pending state |
| `Common/States` → `NotFoundState`, `DetailState` | 404-aware single-object pattern |
| `ui/textarea`, `ui/native-select` | form controls the shell did not yet have |

### Tests

`src/test/projects.test.tsx` renders the real route tree with the Auth0 SDK
and the generated client mocked: list rendering and filtering, empty and
error states, create / edit bodies, role gating, delete, sign-off / reopen,
not-found for a hidden object, a malformed id and a cross-project URL.

### Decisions for the owner (increment 07)

11. **Edit and delete exist in the UI.** The legacy SPA could only create
    projects and inspections; the rebuilt screens expose the `PUT`/`DELETE`
    routes ported in increment 04 (owners for projects, inspectors and
    owners for inspections), each behind a confirmation.
12. **Editing a signed-off inspection is disabled** in the menu until it is
    reopened, matching the API's 409 on new findings while closed. The API
    itself still accepts `PUT` on a closed inspection; say the word and the
    backend rejects it too.
13. **New inspections default to type Civil and the signed-in person's
    name as inspector**, the legacy select's first option and the common
    case for a solo inspector. Both are editable in the form.
14. **Creating a project or inspection opens it** instead of returning to
    the list (the legacy SPA reloaded the list). One tap fewer to the first
    inspection or finding.

## Later increments

- 08 — findings + photo capture fill the "Findings and photos" section of
  the inspection screen (camera-first flow).
- 09 — drawings section + viewer join the project screen.
- 10 — members panel joins the project screen; reports, dashboard roll-up,
  in-app Help.
